intro: 
  I am a data/business analyst with economics background and strong foundation in programming and applied research. I specialize in transforming data into insights that help informed decision-making, improve processes, and support strategic business outcomes. I often use causal inference and experimentation methods.

  
  I recently completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, expanding my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and business problem-solving using industry-standard tools.

  
  I’m passionate about turning complex data sets into into insights that support efficient business strategies like pricing, demand prediction, advertising efficacy, and warehouse planning.
